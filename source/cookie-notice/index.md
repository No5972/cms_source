Last updated: Sep 14, 2020

This Cookie Notice explains how websites operated within the no5972.github.io (referred to herein as "we" or "us") (and in some instances, may be operated in conjunction with one of our distribution partners) use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites ("Websites").  It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

## I. WTF are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.  Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. 

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, No.5972) are called "first party cookies".  Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics).  The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites. 

## II. Why do we use cookies?
We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites.   Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.  This is described in more detail below.
