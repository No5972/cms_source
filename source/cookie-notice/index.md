# No5972.github.io Cookie Notice

Last updated: Sep 24, 2020

This Cookie Notice explains how websites operated within the no5972.github.io (referred to herein as "we", "us", or "our") (and in some instances, may be operated in conjunction with one of our distribution partners) use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites ("Websites").  It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

## I. WTF are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.  Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. 

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, No.5972) are called "first party cookies".  Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics).  The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites. 

## II. Why do we use cookies?
We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites.   Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.  This is described in more detail below.


| Types of cookie | Who serves these cookies | How to refuse |

However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like videos) may become unavailable. | Addthis<br>https://addthis.com<br><br>jsDelivr <br>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net | To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading “How can I control cookies?”.<br>Alternatively, please click on the relevant opt-out link below:<br>Addthis: https://www.oracle.com/legal/privacy/addthis-privacy-policy.html.<br>jsDelivr: https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net |

## III. What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website.  We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs").  These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail that we have sent them.  This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.  In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

## IV. Do you serve targeted advertising?
Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information about your visits to this Website and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.


## V. How can I control cookies?
