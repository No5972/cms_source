Last updated: Nov 29, 2022

This Cookie Notice explains how websites operated within the no5972.github.io (referred to herein as "we", "us", or "our") (and in some instances, may be operated in conjunction with one of our distribution partners) use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites ("Websites").

## I. WTF are cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.  Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. 

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, No.5972) are called "first party cookies".  Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics).  The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
