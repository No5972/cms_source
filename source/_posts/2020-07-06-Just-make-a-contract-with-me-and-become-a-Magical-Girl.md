That's horrible...<br>
You can't help it.<br>
One person can't handle this alone.<br>
But she knew that and came here anyway.<br>
No, this isn't right, it's too much for her...<br>
If she gives up, it's over.<br>
But, you have the power to change this destiny.<br>
All this tragedy, all this destruction, you can change it, if you want.<br>
The power to do so lies within you.<br>
I can change it?<br>
Even someone like me can do something to help?<br>
Can I really change how this ends?<br>
Of course, you can.<br>
Just make a contract with me, and become a Magical Girl!<br>
<br>
That was a crazy dream...<br>
Good morning, Dad.<br>
Oh, good morning, Madoka.<br>
Mom up yet?<br>
Tatsuya's waking her up.<br>
He might need some help, though.<br>
Okay.<br>
Mama, mama!<br>
Wake up, wake up!<br>
C'mon, mama!<br>
Mama, mama!<br>
Rise and shine!!<br>
Urghhhhhhhh!!<br>
......What the...?<br>
Mama woke up, yay!<br>
What's happening in your world?<br>
Well, Hitomi got another love letter.<br>
It's the second one this month.<br>
Huh, if he can't say to her face, he's not worth it.<br>
How's Kazuko doing?<br>
I think her new boyfriend's working out.<br>
She can't seem to talk about anything else during homeroom.<br>
This week's their three months anniversary, so I guess that's the record.<br>
Oh I hope they can make it.<br>
They're at a critical stage in their relationship.<br>
They are?<br>
If it's not the real thing, this is usually when it starts to fall apart.<br>
But if they made it this far, they should be okay for another year.<br>
Oh...<br>
I look fabulous.<br>
I wonder which ribbon I should wear.<br>
Really?<br>
It's not too flashy?<br>
There's no such thing as too flashy, hon.<br>
A woman can't afford to get teased 'cause she looks sloppy.<br>
Hah, perfect!<br>
Your secret admirers are gonna get all wobbly and knees.<br>
I don't have secret admirers.<br>
But you should dress and behave like you do.<br>
That's the secret every pretty girl should know.<br>
Hehe..<br>
Ah...<br>
Uh-oh!<br>
Yay, safe!<br>
Now be good, and eat it all up, okay?<br>
Okay!<br>
Hey honey, some more coffee?<br>
Uh...<br>
I better not.<br>
All right!<br>
I'm off to work, everyone.<br>
Have a good day, honey.<br>
Bye, mama.<br>
Hey, you're gonna be late if you don't hurry.<br>
Huh?!<br>
Oh yeah.<br>
See you later!<br>
Have a great day!<br>
Have a great day!<br>
<br>
Good morning, guys!<br>
Good morning.<br>
What took you so long, Madoka?<br>
Look at you with your cute ribbons.<br>
You think so?<br>
They're not too flashy?<br>
I think they look lovely.<br>
My mom said that if a boy can't say he loves you to your face, he's not worth your time.<br>
Your mom is way cool, Madoka!<br>
I mean she's smart, gorgeous and successful.<br>
If only I could make up my mind as easily as that.<br>
If only everyone could have your problems.<br>
You know, she is right.<br>
I wish someone would send me a love letter some time.<br>
It'd be nice to get one.<br>
Ah, now I get it.<br>
You want to be as beautiful and popular as Hitomi, don't ya?<br>
I bet that's why you're wearing those ribbons to change your image.<br>
That's not true!<br>
My mom picked these out and...<br>
You tricked your mom to tell you the secret to being popular, didn't you?<br>
I'm not gonna let that happen!<br>
Ha!<br>
No!<br>
No, stop it!<br>
No!<br>
You're just too cute!<br>
I'm not gonna let you be popular with the boys.<br>
You're mine, Madoka!<br>
Mine, mine, mine.<br>
Ahem.<br>
Ahem.<br>
<br>
I have a very important issue to discuss today.<br>
So eyes front, ears open!<br>
The correct way to fry an egg is sunny side up or down.<br>
Come on, Nakazawa. I don't have all day.<br>
I... I gue... uh...<br>
You can fry either way, can't you?<br>
Yes, precisely.<br>
You can fry either way!<br>
Therefore, go through without saying that you should never judge a women's beauty by the way she fries her eggs.<br>
Remember, girls, do not associate with men who refuse to eat eggs that's been fried sunny side down.<br>
I guess it didn't work out.<br>
But what gave you that idea?<br>
And you boys, better make sure you don't grow up to be men who complain about how the damn eggs are cooked, understand?!<br>
Well, now that that's out of the way, let's give a big warm welcome to our new classmate!<br>
Uh, maybe that should've come first?<br>
Come in, Miss Akemi.<br>
Don't be shy!<br>
Wow!<br>
Wow, she's super gorgeous.<br>
Huh?<br>
No way!<br>
It couldn't be!<br>
Why don't you tell the class a little bit about yourself.<br>
I'm Homura Akemi.<br>
It's nice to meet you.<br>
Uh...<br>
Um...<br>
Uh, Miss Akemi?<br>
<br>
What school did you go to before coming to this one?<br>
I went to a private Catholic school in Tokyo.<br>
Were you in a club?<br>
How about sports?<br>
Were you on any teams?<br>
No, not really.<br>
Your hair is really beautiful!<br>
What kind of shampoo do you like to use?<br>
There's something awfully mysterious about that girl, don't you think?<br>
Hey, Madoka, do you know that girl?<br>
I could've sworn to you she was glaring at you when she was in front of the class.<br>
Well, I'm not really sure...<br>
I'm sorry.<br>
I think today's been a little stressful for me.<br>
I'm not feeling very well.<br>
May I please go to the Nurse's Office?<br>
Ah, sure.<br>
If you want, I can take you over there.<br>
Good idea!<br>
Can I come too?<br>
Please don't trouble yourselves.<br>
I'll ask the Nurse's Aide to take me.<br>
Huh?<br>
Miss Madoka Kaname.<br>
You are the Nurse's Aide for this class, are you not?<br>
Huh?<br>
Um, well...<br>
I uh...<br>
Would you please come with me?<br>
To the Nurse's Office.<br>
Um, I...was...<br>
H-How did you know I was the Nurse's Aide for the class?<br>
Ms Saotome told me that you were.<br>
Oh, right, of course she did.<br>
By the way, the Nurse's Office is over there.<br>
This way, right?<br>
Huh?<br>
Uh, yeah, that's right.<br>
But, um...<br>
So anyway, how do you know your way there?<br>
I mean you're new here and all.<br>
Um...Miss, um...Akemi?<br>
Call me Homura.<br>
Oh, Homura.<br>
What is it?<br>
Uh, nothing. It's just that...you have an unusual name.<br>
But not in a bad way or anything, I was just thinking how it sounded cool...<br>
for a first name, I mean.<br>
Madoka Kaname, do you treasure the life you currently live?<br>
And do you consider your family and your friends precious?<br>
Oh, well, I uh...<br>
Of course I do.<br>
I mean I-I do.<br>
My family and my friends, I love them very much and yes they're very precious to me.<br>
Do you mean it?<br>
Absolutely.<br>
I couldn't lie about that!<br>
Good.<br>
Because if that's the truth, then you wouldn't try changing the life you have or the person you are.<br>
Otherwise, you'd lose everything you love.<br>
Huh?<br>
Don't change.<br>
Stay as you are, Madoka Kaname.<br>
Stay as you are, forever.<br>
<br>
Wow...<br>
Wow...<br>
She breaks the record of every school in this city?!<br>
I can't believe you can jump that high!<br>
<br>
She said what?!<br>
It doesn't make any sense, does it?<br>
When I was thinking she was this awesome girl but it turns out she is a total psycho!<br>
Ah! I hope she doesn't think acting like a weird transfer student is cool.<br>
That's so MOE? It makes me sick!<br>
This has to be misunderstanding.<br>
Are you positive you've never met her before?<br>
Hmm...<br>
I guess the sensible answer will be "yes."<br>
Okay, what do you mean by sensible?<br>
Either you met her or you didn't?<br>
Well, it's like...<br>
You're gonna think I'm weird but I first met her in a dream or something.<br>
Hahahaha... That's awesome!<br>
An anime character in you's popping out, too!<br>
Come on, that's mean!<br>
This is really bugging me!<br>
I got it all figured out.<br>
You guys knew each other in the past life and the fate is reached across time and space to bring you back together again.<br>
In your dream, what happened when you met her?<br>
That's the thing. I can't really remember what happened in it.<br>
All I know is that was really strange and spooky.<br>
If you want my opinion, I think it's entirely possibly you met Miss Akemi somewhere before.<br>
Huh?!<br>
You might not remember meeting her, but your subconscious certainly took note of it.<br>
When you were having that dream, your subconscious simply brought up the image of her.<br>
Seriously?<br>
That's the heck of coincidence, don't you think?<br>
Uh, perhaps.<br>
Uh-oh, look how late it's gotten.<br>
Excuse me, but I really should be going now.<br>
Is it Piano today or classical dance?<br>
Tea Ceremony lessons today.<br>
Even though our Exams are coming up, my mother still wants me to continue taking them.<br>
Yeah, there's another reason to be glad I wasn't born a rich girl.<br>
We should get going too.<br>
Madoka, you wanna hit the music store on the way home?<br>
Okay.<br>
Something for Kyosuke again?<br>
Yeah, maybe.<br>
Have fun shopping!<br>
Bye bye!<br>
Later!<br>
<br>
Help me!<br>
Huh?<br>
Madoka, help me!<br>
Huh?<br>
What?!<br>
Please...help me!<br>
Huh?<br>
Hello?<br>
Who are you?<br>
Help me..!<br>
Where are you?<br>
Um, do I know you?<br>
Help me!<br>
Is that you?<br>
Help me...<br>
Homura?<br>
Get away from that creature.<br>
B-But he's really hurt.<br>
Leave him alone.<br>
Why are you trying to hurt him?<br>
This doesn't concern you.<br>
But he was calling me!<br>
I could hear him calling my name!<br>
He was asking me to help him!<br>
Really?<br>
Over here, Madoka!<br>
Sayaka!<br>
Why is this happening now?<br>
Now she's attacking you on cosplay?<br>
What's her problem?<br>
And what's that thing you're carrying?<br>
Looks like a stuffed animal. Is it alive?<br>
I don't know.<br>
I don't know why this is happening, but we have to save him!<br>
Where'd the exit go?<br>
Where are we?<br>
I don't like this place.<br>
Everything keeps changing!<br>
Oh, crap!<br>
What the heck's going on?!<br>
There's something over there!<br>
Is this some kinda joke, right?<br>
I'm stuck in a bad dream, but I am dreaming, right?<br>
Right, Madoka?!<br>
What's happening?<br>
I don't know.<br>
That was close, wasn't it?<br>
But don't worry, you're safe now.<br>
Thank goodness.<br>
You rescued Kyubey for me.<br>
I'm very grateful.<br>
He's a dear friend of mine and I was so worried.<br>
He called out to me.<br>
I could hear his voice inside my head.<br>
Ahh, I see.<br>
I can tell by your uniforms that you both go to Mitakihara Middle School.<br>
Are you 8th graders?<br>
Who are you?<br>
Oh, that's right.<br>
Maybe I should introduce myself.<br>
Actually, it's going to have to wait a bit.<br>
Please excuse me.<br>
I have to wrap this up first.<br>
Wow, amazing!<br>
We're back!<br>
The witch managed to escape.<br>
If you wanna finish it off, you'd better go after it.<br>
I won't mind if you take it this time.<br>
But I still have work to do here.<br>
You don't understand, do you?<br>
I'm telling you I'm willing to overlook this.<br>
Honestly, don't you think it would be best if we didn't do this right now?<br>
Thank you, Mami!<br>
You're a lifesaver!<br>
I'm not the one you should be thanking.<br>
They saved you.<br>
I was just passing by.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much!<br>
My name is Kyubey.<br>
Were you the one who was calling for help?<br>
That's right, Madoka Kaname,<br>
And Sayaka Miki.<br>
Wow, hang on a sec.<br>
How do you know our names?<br>
I came here because I have a favor to ask of you both.<br>
Huh?<br>
What do you mean?<br>
I want you to make contracts with me, and become magical girls!<br>
